# TaskFlow - Collaborative Task Management App

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: TaskFlow is a comprehensive task management application that enables teams to organize, track, and collaborate on projects through visual Kanban boards with real-time updates and calendar integration.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can seamlessly create, assign, and track tasks across multiple project boards
- Teams experience real-time collaboration without conflicts or data loss
- Calendar integration provides clear visibility into deadlines and upcoming work
- Dashboard analytics help teams understand productivity patterns and bottlenecks

**Experience Qualities**: Efficient, Collaborative, Intuitive

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with multi-user state management, real-time updates, and comprehensive project management features)

**Primary User Activity**: Creating and Interacting (users actively create tasks, move them through workflows, collaborate in real-time, and analyze progress)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Teams need a unified space to visualize work progress, coordinate efforts, and meet deadlines without losing track of individual responsibilities or project timelines.

**User Context**: Teams use this daily for project management, sprint planning, and progress tracking. Individual contributors need to see their assignments while project managers need overview insights.

**Critical Path**: User authentication → Board access → Task creation/assignment → Status updates → Deadline tracking → Progress analysis

**Key Moments**: 
1. Creating and assigning a new task with clear expectations
2. Moving tasks through workflow stages with real-time team visibility  
3. Meeting deadlines through calendar integration and notifications

- **Purpose**: Provides insights for project management and team performance optimization
- **Success Criteria**: Managers can identify bottlenecks and track progress toward goals

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should feel organized, trustworthy, and empowering. Users should feel confident that their work is being tracked effectively and that they have clear visibility into project status.

**Design Personality**: Professional yet approachable - clean and systematic like Linear/Notion but warm enough for daily team collaboration.

**Visual Metaphors**: Physical task boards and calendar planning - familiar organizational tools translated to digital space.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced interface - rich enough to handle complex project data but clean enough for daily usability.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent colors (blues and purples with strategic orange accents)

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - conveys professionalism and trust
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue variations for supporting UI elements
**Accent Color**: Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 45)) - draws attention to important actions and due dates
**Color Psychology**: Blue creates a sense of stability and focus, orange provides energy for action items
**Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards with 4.5:1 contrast ratios

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (white): Dark blue text (4.8:1 ratio)
- Primary (blue): White text (8.2:1 ratio)  
- Accent (orange): White text (5.1:1 ratio)
- Cards (white): Dark text (4.8:1 ratio)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with multiple weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headers: Bold weight, larger sizes for clear section definition
- Body text: Regular weight, comfortable reading size
- Labels: Medium weight, smaller size for form fields and metadata

**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modernity and clarity - professional but not corporate
**Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, generous spacing between sections
**Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) for comprehensive character support and excellent readability
**Legibility Check**: Inter is optimized for screen reading with clear character differentiation

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Board cards use size and color to indicate priority; calendar dates with tasks are highlighted
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding around cards and sections creates breathing room and focuses attention
**Grid System**: Consistent 8px spacing unit throughout, responsive grid for different screen sizes
**Responsive Approach**: Sidebar collapses on mobile, board cards stack vertically, calendar switches to list view
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough information visible without overwhelming users

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth drag-and-drop animations reinforce the physical metaphor of moving task cards
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Task movements are prominent, UI transitions are subtle
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional context requires subtle, functional animations rather than playful effects

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for tasks and dashboard widgets
- Dialogs for task creation/editing  
- Dropdowns for filters and actions
- Calendar component for date visualization
- Badges for status and priority indicators

**Component Customization**: Shadcn components with custom priority colors and status indicators
**Component States**: Clear hover, active, and focus states for all interactive elements
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent style and comprehensive coverage
**Spacing System**: Tailwind's spacing scale (4px increments) for visual consistency
**Mobile Adaptation**: Sidebar converts to drawer, boards switch to single-column view

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent spacing, colors, and interaction patterns
**Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, component variants, spacing units
**Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card sizes, regular spacing intervals, aligned elements
**Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance that builds trust for business team usage

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1) achieved across all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
**Potential Obstacles**: 
- Network connectivity issues during real-time collaboration
- Large numbers of tasks causing performance issues
- Conflicting task assignments or unclear ownership

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Offline mode with sync when reconnected
- Pagination and filtering for large task lists  
- Clear assignee indicators and assignment history

**Technical Constraints**: Browser compatibility for drag-and-drop, WebSocket support for real-time features

## Implementation Considerations
**Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple workspaces, large teams, and extensive task histories
**Testing Focus**: Real-time synchronization accuracy, drag-and-drop functionality across devices
**Critical Questions**: How to handle conflicting simultaneous edits, optimal performance with large datasets

## Reflection
This approach uniquely combines the visual appeal of modern task management tools with the robust functionality needed for serious project management. The calendar integration bridges the gap between task tracking and time management, while real-time collaboration ensures teams stay synchronized. The professional aesthetic builds trust for business use while remaining approachable for daily team interaction.
